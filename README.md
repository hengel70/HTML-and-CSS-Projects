<h3>Space Station Site</h3>
<p>This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.</p>

<h3>Movie Theater Site</h3>
<p>This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootsrap 5. It contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns. Also, the badges don't work, and I can't figure it out</p>
